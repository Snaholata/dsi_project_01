# dsi_project_01: A console-based program implementation using Java with OOP logic for management of products in a store

Problem Statement:
You are starting a small business. So, you need to keep a ledger for all the buys, sells, and available balances on your account. 
When you run the program, it will be able to accept command line inputs. And, will show the result on the command line. 
When engaging with the command line, it will give you options to

1. Add a product
a. A product should have this information
i. Product name
ii. Buy price
iii. Sell price
iv. Available number in the inventory to sell
v. Total profit selling the product
b. One must input all the info in a natural number to add a
product.

2. Delete a product
a. When a product is deleted, it will not show in the list but
the profit made from the product will still be there in the available balance.

3. Buy a product
a. You will select the product and the number of products that
you bought. It will add the number to the inventory of that product. 
The total buy price of the products should be subtracted from the available balance.

4. Sell a product
a. You will select the product and the number of products that
you sold.
b. The profit is the difference between the buying price and
the selling price. The number should be added to profit and the whole selling price should be added to available money.
c. The number of selling products can not exceed the number available in the inventory.

5. See the list of products
a. This list will include the name of the products, the number
of available products in the inventory, and also the profit from each product. Showing these in a tabular form is not mandatory.
But, anyone would love that, right?

6. See available balance
After creating the application, assume you have nothing at the moment. The available balance is also 0 BDT. Now, add five products of your choosing. Sell any three of them.
